# Write a function that gives the Nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the sequence goes like this:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on until infinity...

# Input: 9
# Output: 21 (as this is the 9th number of the Fibonacci Sequence)
#     Note: this output is incorrect by most standards, which count n(1) as 1
#     n(9) would therefore be 34; the function could easily be modified to return the previous number

# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1

# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.
